# NodeJS Essentials With Real-World Examples

Author: IxxI5

### Description

This repository offers a fresh approach to mastering the essentials of NodeJS programming. By using small, simulated real-world examples, it makes learning both intuitive and practical. This hands-on approach ensures that learning is not only easier but also more enjoyable and effective for everyone.

**The simulated real-world examples cover the following modules:**

- **Events**: The "events" module provides an implementation of the event-driven programming paradigm in Node.js. It allows you to create and handle custom events within your applications.

- **FS** (File System): The "fs" module provides an API for interacting with the file system. It allows you to read from and write to files, manage directories, and more.

- **HTTP**: The "http" module provides utilities for creating HTTP servers and clients. It enables Node.js to handle HTTP requests and responses.

- **OS**: The "os" module provides operating system-related utility methods and properties. It helps you gather information about the underlying operating system and hardware.

- **Path**: The "path" module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. It helps handle and manipulate file paths in a cross-platform way.

- **Pipe**: The "pipe" method (stream module)is used with streams to connect the output of one stream to the input of another, effectively creating a pipeline.

- **Stream**: The "stream" module provides a way to handle streaming data, allowing you to read and write data in chunks rather than all at once.

- **URL**: The "url" module provides utilities for URL resolution and parsing. It helps in handling and manipulating URLs.

### Prerequisites

- **VS Code** is installed or download it from: https://code.visualstudio.com/

- **Node JS** is installed or download the latest version from: https://nodejs.org/en

### Launch a sub-project

After downloading the node-essentials repository, follow these steps:

- **Unzip** the downloaded file.
- **Open** VS Code Terminal
- **Launch** a sub-project e.g. ns01_events_demo from Terminal:

  ```javascript
  npm run start:ns01                 /* runs the ns01_events_demo/index.js */
  ```
